## ðŸš§ Known issues
1. bleak causes Python to crash on Mac: https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/issues/768
    * possible solution: give access to iTerm (or whichever terminal you use) to Bluetooth in Settings

3. main_server script terminal crashes on start of script: incompatible version of IronOS, check/update firmware see above.

4. Windows Powershell issue
    * windows by default does not allow any scripts to run in powershell. Make sure the zip file property is _Unblock_ ([reference](https://github.com/builder555/PineSAM/discussions/106#discussion-4960445)) and set powershell to remotesigned with:<br/>
    `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`
    * check that windows has not reset the permissions in powershell with `Get-ExecutionPolicy` and change it back to `RemoteSigned` if needed ([reference](https://lazyadmin.nl/powershell/running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/)).
