# Backend servers

* Python scripts run the backend server inside a terminal window (e.g. powershell)
* The browser UI is run by "serve" and the backend python is run by "main_server".
* Terminal messages contain useful information for development (dev) and troubleshooting.
* BLE MAC address of the pinecil for example is in the terminal line "Found pinecil at" C4:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

## User Interface
* The UI runs in any browser and is where you can interact and make changes to pinecil.
